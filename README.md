# A Flappy Bird remake in Computercraft.

Code sucks, please dont use this to see how to code something like this, i really dont know what I'm doing. Very unoptimized too.

To Download onto your minecraft computer run:
```
wget https://github.com/bartek18887/ComputerCraft-FlappyBird/raw/main/main.lua flappybird.lua
```
and it should download. after it downloads, run it by typing `flappybird`
